## EXPIRED: Description

- The purpose of this project? UARK 2022 FALL HACKATHON! Additionally, we all enjoy coding and so building EXPIRED was an enjoyment as a team.
- What is EXPIRED? This is a pantry tracker smart home device which runs on a mobile device. It captures information through a camera and uses a UPC API to gather data. This data is then sent to a web app that is ran on a cellular device to be able to track information, expiry dates, and recipes. This allows the user to check their pantry away from home and innovates the theme with a sustainability aspect.
- The biggest problem for food wasting comes from households. 43% of waste is from homes and with expired we are able to solve this issue.
- Through this project, we learned that Raspberry Pi is more difficult to implement than we thought, but we powered through and innovated alternatives.

## Installation

For now, the way to access our project is to go to: [EXPIRED WEBAPP](https://expired.deta.dev)
The scanning portion of this project will only run locally on our iPhones, but we will implement a feature so that it can be run on all devices.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
