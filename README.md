# <EXPIRED>

## EXPIRED: Description

- The purpose of this project? UARK 2022 FALL HACKATHON! Additionally, we all enjoy coding and so building EXPIRED was an enjoyment as a team.
- What is EXPIRED? This is a pantry tracker smart home device which runs on a mobile device. It captures information through a camera and uses a UPC API to gather data. This data is then sent to a web app that is ran on a cellular device to be able to track information, expiry dates, and recipes. This allows the user to check their pantry away from home and innovates the theme with a sustainability aspect.
- The biggest problem for food wasting comes from households. 43% of waste is from homes and with expired we are able to solve this issue.
- Through this project, we learned that Raspberry Pi is more difficult to implement than we thought, but we powered through and innovated alternatives.
